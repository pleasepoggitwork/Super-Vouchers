# Super-Vouchers
Super-Vouchers is a plugin to add vouchers to your pocketmine server. These vouchers come in multipile kinds, from rank vouchers,
to command vouchers, and much more.
To give yourself or anohter player a voucher do /vouchertype player. For expample to give Bob a Fix voucher you can do /fixv bob.
Now Bob can right click the voucher to redeem the ability to do /fix. If Bob already had permissions to /fix, he wont be able to use
the voucher! Currently you need EssentialsPE to make this plugin work, but I am planning on making a revamped EssentialsPE!
